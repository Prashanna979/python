# A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence
# (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).

# while loops
# for loops
#
# for loop
# A for loop in Python repeats executing a code block from a sequence till certain number of times

# For loops are designed for iterating over a sequence of items. Eg. list, tuple, etc.
# For loop is more efficient than a while loop when iterating over sequences,
# since the number of iterations is predetermined and the loop can be optimized accordingly.

# fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
# for x in fruits:
#   print(x)
#

# print only if condition is fulfilled
#   fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
#   for x in fruits:
#       if x == "banana":
#           break
#       print(x)

# looping a set number of times using range
# for x in range(2, 6):
#     print(x)

# Nested loop(loops inside a loop)
# adj = ["red", "big", "tasty"]
# fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
#
# for x in adj:
#   for y in fruits:
#     print(x, y)

# # While loop
# While loop is used when the number of iterations is not known in advance
# or when we want to repeat a block of code until a certain condition is met.

# In Python, we use the while loop to repeat a block of code until a certain condition is met.
# i = 1
# while i < 6:
#   print(i)
#   i += 1

# i = 1
# while i < 6:
#   print(i)
#   i += 1
# else:
#   print("i is no longer less than 6")
